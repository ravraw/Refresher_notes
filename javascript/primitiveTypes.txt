A primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods.
In JavaScript, there are 6 primitive data types:

- string, 
- number, 
- boolean,
- null, 
- undefined, 
- symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015).

All primitives are immutable, i.e., they cannot be altered. 
It is important not to confuse a primitive itself with a variable assigned a primitive value. The variable may be reassigned a new value, but the existing value can not be changed in the ways that objects, arrays, and functions can be altered.

A primitive can be replaced, but it can't be directly altered.
